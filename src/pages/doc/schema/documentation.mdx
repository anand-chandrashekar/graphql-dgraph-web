You can document you api with `""" ... """` style GraphQL documentation (this gets passed through to the generated API and is shown as documentation in GraphQL tools like graphiql, graphql Playground, etc .... so maybe needs an example)

You can also add `# ...` comments where ever you like ... those are just like code comments on the input schema and get dropped.  (any comment starting with `# Dgraph` is reserved)
