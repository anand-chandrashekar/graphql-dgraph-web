(these two should be in some sort of call out or different font or something)

* If you're new to Dgraph, you are best of heading to our Quick Start(**link**).
* These docs tell you all the details.  If you are looking for a walk through tutorial, then head over to our tutorials section(**link**).


Dgraph gives you GraphQL.  You're always working with GraphQL, not a translation layer.  When you build an app with Dgraph, Dgraph is your GraphQL database.

## Exploring the docs

* [How it Works] Once you have got yourself started with with the quick start(**link**) and tutorials(**link**), you might need to review "How it works" and "App Architecture with Dgraph" to work out how you are going to design you app with Dgraph.
* [Schema] You'll need the schema reference to find out about all the options of what can be in your schema.
* [Subscriptions] GraphQL subscriptions help you make your APP more responsive or, for example, add live feeds.  Dgraph can generate subscriptions for you.
* [Custom Logic] Dgraph's auto generated GraphQL API is fantastic, but as your app gets more complicated, you'll need to add custom business logic to your API.
* [Authorization] Dgraph can add automated authorization to your GraphQL API.
* [Administration] Once you're up and running you might also need to know a few details about administering your Dgraph instance and doing migrations.  You'll find that in the admin(**link**) and dgraph(**link**) sections.
