**FIXME: needs to mention aplication/graphql, needs to talk about the response formate, needs to mention the extensions (and how to turn them off)**

# Requests

GraphQL requests can be sent via HTTP POST or HTTP GET requests.

## POST requests

For POST requests, the body must be sent with the Content-Type header `application/json` and encoded with the following form.

```json
{
  "query": "...",
  "operationName": "...",
  "variables": { "var": "val", ... }
}
```

## GET requests

For GET requests, the query, variables and operation are sent as query parameters in the url.

```
http://localhost:8080/graphql?query={...}&variables={...}&operation=...
```

In both cases, only `query` is required. `variables` is only required if the query contains GraphQL variables: i.e. it starts like `query myQuery($var: String...)`. While, `operationName` is required if there are multiple operations in the query; in which case, operations must also be named.

# Responses

## Format

# Compression

Compressed requests and responses are available with gzip. Set header `Content-Encoding` to `gzip` to post encoded data, and `Accept-Encoding` to `gzip` to receive a compressed response.
