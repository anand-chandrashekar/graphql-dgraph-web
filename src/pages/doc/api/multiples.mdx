**FIXME: should discuss multiple queries/mutations in a single operation, as well as multiple operations in a request and how they  have to be named then**

you can do this
```
query {
  q1 { ... }
  q2 { ... }
}
```

and you can do this

```
query Op1  {
  q1 { ... }
  q2 { ... }  
}

query Op2 {
    q3 { ... }
    q4 { ... }
}
```

when you do the second,  you need to include the operation name in the request (see on request page) 

... what's the result look like in each case

When an operation contains multiple queries, they are run concurrently and independently in a  Dgraph transaction each.

When an operation contains multiple mutations, they are run serially, in the order listed in the request, and in a transaction per mutation. If a mutation fails, the following mutations are not executed, and previous mutations are not rolled back.
