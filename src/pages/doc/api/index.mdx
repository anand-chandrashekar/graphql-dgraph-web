How to use the GraphQL API. 

**FIXME: just a quick description of what's served, not much needed here ... though it shouldn't be localhost, cause that doesn't work with slash**

Dgraph serves [spec compliant
GraphQL](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/) over HTTP. By
default, GraphQL is served at `http://localhost:8080/graphql`. Both GET and POST
requests are served.
