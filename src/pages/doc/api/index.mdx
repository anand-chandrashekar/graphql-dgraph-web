How to use the GraphQL API. 

Dgraph serves [spec-compliant
GraphQL](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/) over HTTP to two endpoints: `/graphql` and `/admin`. By
default, GraphQL is served at `https://YOUR-SUBDOMAIN.REGION.aws.cloud.dgraph.io`. Both GET and POST
requests are served.


- `/graphql` is where you'll find the GraphQL API for the types you've added. That is the single GraphQL entry point for your apps to Dgraph.

- `/admin` is where you'll find an admin API for administering your GraphQL instance. That's where you can update your GraphQL schema, perform health checks of your backend, and more.

This section covers the API served at `/graphql`. See [Admin](/doc/admin) to learn more about the admin API.
