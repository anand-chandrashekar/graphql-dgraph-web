title: 'Administering Your Slash GraphQL Backend'

<h1>{props.pageContext.frontmatter.title}</h1>

*These are draft docs for Slash GraphQL, which is currently in beta*

Here is a guide to programatically administering your Slash GraphQL backend. Wherever possible, we have maintained compatibility with the corresponding Dgraph API, with the additional step of requiring authentication via the 'X-Auth-Token' header.

## Authentication and Endpoint

All the APIs documented here require an API token for access. A new API token can be generated from Slash GraphQL by selecting the ["Settings" button](https://slash.dgraph.io/_/settings) from the sidebar, then clicking the Add API Key button. Do remember to keep your API key safely, as we will not show you the same API key again.

All admin API requests must be authenticated by passing the API token as the 'X-Auth-Token' header to every HTTP request. You can check if your API token works by using the following HTTP example.

```sh
curl 'https://testy-sink-2236.us-west-2.aws.cloud.dgraph.io/admin' \
  -H 'X-Auth-Token: <your-token>' \
  --data-binary '{"query":"{ getGQLSchema { schema } }"}'
```

In order to get the admin endpoint, replace the `/graphql` from your GraphQL Backend url with `/admin` or `/admin/slash`, depending on which API you are trying to access.

## Fetching and Updating Your Schema

Your GraphQL schema can be fetched and updated using the `/admin` endpoint of your cluster. This endpoint works in a similar way to the [/admin](https://graphql.dgraph.io/doc/admin) endpoint of Dgraph, with the additional constraint of requiring authentication, as described in the Authentication section above.

### Fetching the Current Schema

It is possible to fetch your current schema using the `getGQLSchema` query on `/admin`. Below is a sample GraphQL query which will fetch this schema.
```graphql
{
  getGQLSchema {
    schema
  }
}
```

### Setting a New Schema

You can save a new schema using the `updateGQLSchema` mutation on `/admin`. Below is an example GraphQL body, with a variable called sch which must be passed in as a [variable](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/passing-arguments/)

```graphql
mutation($sch: String!) {
  updateGQLSchema(input: { set: { schema: $sch}})
  {
    gqlSchema {
      schema
      generatedSchema
    }
  }
}
```

## Exporting Data

It is possible to export your data via a JSON format. In order to do this, call the `export` mutation on `/admin/slash`. Do note that this endpoint requires Authentication as described in the sections above.

Below is a sample GraphQL body to export data to JSON.

```graphql
{
  mutation {
    export {
      response { code message }
      signedUrls
    }
  }
}
```

The `signedUrls` output field contains a list of URLs which can be downloaded. These files can be imported into a local Dgraph cluster with [live loader](https://dgraph.io/docs/deploy/#live-loader). The URLs will expire after 48 hours.
