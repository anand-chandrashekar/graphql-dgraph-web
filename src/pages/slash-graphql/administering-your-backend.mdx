<h1>{props.pageContext.frontmatter.title}</h1>

*These are draft docs for Slash GraphQL, which is currently in beta*

Here is a guide to programatically administering your Slash GraphQL backend. Wherever possible, we have maintained compatibility with the corresponding Dgraph API, with the additional step of requiring authentication via the 'X-Auth-Token' header.

## Authentication and Endpoint

All the APIs documented here require an API token for access. A new API token can be generated from Slash GraphQL by selecting the ["Settings" button](https://slash.dgraph.io/_/settings) from the sidebar, then clicking the Add API Key button. Keep your API key safe, it will not be accessible once you leave the page.

All admin API requests must be authenticated by passing the API token as the 'X-Auth-Token' header to every HTTP request. You can check if your API token works by using the following HTTP example.

```sh
curl 'https://<your-backend>/admin' \
  -H 'X-Auth-Token: <your-token>' \
  --data-binary '{"query":"{ getGQLSchema { schema } }"}'
```

In order to get the admin endpoint, replace the `/graphql` from your GraphQL Backend url with `/admin` or `/admin/slash`, depending on which API you are trying to access.

## Fetching and Updating Your Schema

Your GraphQL schema can be fetched and updated using the `/admin` endpoint of your cluster. As an example, if your graphql endpoint is `https://frozen-mango-42.us-west-2.aws.cloud.dgraph.io/graphql`, then the admin endpoint for schema will be at `https://frozen-mango.us-west-2.aws.cloud.dgraph.io/admin`.

This endpoint works in a similar way to the [/admin](https://graphql.dgraph.io/doc/admin) endpoint of Dgraph, with the additional constraint of requiring authentication, as described in the Authentication section above.

### Fetching the Current Schema

It is possible to fetch your current schema using the `getGQLSchema` query on `/admin`. Below is a sample GraphQL query which will fetch this schema.
```graphql
{
  getGQLSchema {
    schema
  }
}
```

### Setting a New Schema

You can save a new schema using the `updateGQLSchema` mutation on `/admin`. Below is an example GraphQL body, with a variable called sch which must be passed in as a [variable](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/passing-arguments/)

```graphql
mutation($sch: String!) {
  updateGQLSchema(input: { set: { schema: $sch}})
  {
    gqlSchema {
      schema
      generatedSchema
    }
  }
}
```

## Exporting Data

It is possible to export your data via a JSON format. In order to do this, call the `export` mutation on `/admin/slash`. As an example, if your graphql endpoint is `https://frozen-mango-42.us-west-2.aws.cloud.dgraph.io/graphql`, then the admin endpoint for schema will be at `https://frozen-mango.us-west-2.aws.cloud.dgraph.io/admin/slash`.

Please note that this endpoint requires Authentication as described in the sections above.

Below is a sample GraphQL body to export data to JSON.

```graphql
{
  mutation {
    export {
      response { code message }
      signedUrls
    }
  }
}
```

The `signedUrls` output field contains a list of URLs which can be downloaded. These files can be imported into another Slash Backend with [live loader](#importing-data-with-live-loader). The URLs will expire after 48 hours.

## Importing data with Live Loader

It is possible to import data into a Slash GraphQL backend using [live loader](https://dgraph.io/docs/deploy/#live-loader). In order to import data, do the following steps

1. First import your schema into your Slash GraphQL backend, using either the APIs above or via [the Schema Page](https://slash.dgraph.io/_/schema).
2. Find the gRPC endpoint for your cluster, as described in the [advanced queries](./advanced-queries) section. This will look like frozen-mango-42.grpc.us-west-1.aws.cloud.dgraph.io:443
3. Run the live loader as follows. Do note that running this via docker requires you to use an unreleased tag (either master or v20.07-slash)

```shell
docker run -it --rm -v /path/to/g01.json.gz:/tmp/g01.json.gz dgraph:dgraph/v20.07-slash \
  dgraph live --slash_grpc_endpoint=<grpc-endpoint>:443 -f /tmp/g01.json.gz -t <api-token>
```
