title: 'Advanced Queries with GraphQL+-'
---
<h1>{props.pageContext.frontmatter.title}</h1>

*These are draft docs for Slash GraphQL, which is currently in beta*

Slash GraphQL also supports running advanced queries with `GraphQL+-`, a query language that is unique to Dgraph. GraphQL+- should be used by advanced users who wish to make queries and mutations using existing Dgraph client libraries, either via the HTTP or GRPC endpoints.

If you are getting started with Slash GraphQL, you might want to consider using our GraphQL APIs instead (link to graphql docs here)

Do note that Slash GraphQL does not allow you to change the schema or create new predicates via GraphQL+-. 

## Authentication and Endpoint

It is important to note that all APIs must be authenticated by an API key from the settings page.

### HTTP
For HTTP requests it must be passed in a header (name, example). For HTTP, you must use the same hostname as your endpoint.

### GRPC
For GRPC requests it must be passed in as metadata to every request (name, example). How to find the GRPC endpoint

## Limitations

It should be possible to use most GRPC based libraries to access . We will add support to ratel and dgraph-js-http. We will also be figuring out a way to get this to work with live loader. Please watch out for releases.
